snow_melt
=========

This is a project by Jeff Dozier to estimate the amount of snow water equivalent (SWE) in a mountainous region based on satellite imagery. The best existing method is reconstruction, which can only be performed after snow melt has completed for the year. The goal is to estimate current SWE in near real time (within a day or a week).
